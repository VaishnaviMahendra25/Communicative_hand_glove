Communicative Hand Glove 

• Worked in a Team of four and successfully developed Hand Glove Communication System for the speech - impaired individuals using Arduino Nano and Flex Sensors based on the Standard American Sign Language and the angles made between the flex sensors

• Implemented an efficient C++ program that interfaces with the hardware components, allowing for smooth communication and control 

• Integrated with Accelerometer for accurate measurement of hand movement, HC-05 Bluetooth for wireless transmission from glove to device.

• Created a simulation model of the same on TinkerCAD software. This can be further used to vocalise frequently used phrases
